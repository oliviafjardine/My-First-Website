        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>#MadeInChina: Small baby me was born in China, but within
        6 months, I was adopted by my mom and dad and became an American.
        Raised in Seattle, Washington, I enjoy exploring the ins and outs
        of the big city. The abundance of sites, activies, food, and
        beautiful nature has and will always carry my interest and
        enjoyment. I would consider myself an curious person as I like
        to try new things. This has led to my hobbies that include
        creating art, going on walks, coding, listening to music, writing,
        and quite frankly, anything that peaks my interest.
